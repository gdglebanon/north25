In this workshop, we bridge that gap by introducing participants to Explainable AI (XAI) through the power of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Neo4j.\n\nThe session begins with an accessible introduction to knowledge graphs, graph structures, and why KGs are becoming essential for AI transparency. Then, in a fully hands-on segment, participants will model users, skills, roles, and companies into a real knowledge graph using Neo4j\u2019s browser-based sandbox. They\u2019ll learn how to write graph queries that surface the exact skill matches, experience alignments, and interest connections that justify a job recommendation.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, attendees will have built a mini Explainable Job-Matching System capable of showing users why a particular job fits them  using clear, visual reasoning paths directly derived from the knowledge graph. Whether you're a student discovering AI or a developer exploring semantic technologies, you\u2019ll leave with practical skills in combining KGs + XAI to create transparent, trustworthy AI systems used in modern platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed.",
